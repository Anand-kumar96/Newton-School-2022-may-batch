Shortest Distance Between Vertex
Time Limit: 2 sec
Memory Limit: 128000 kB
Problem Statement
We have an undirected graph G with N vertices and N edges. The vertices are numbered from 1 to N.
For all i = 1, 2, 3,. , N-1, there is an edge between vertex i and vertex i+1.
There is one other edge between vertex A and vertex B.

Now for each k from 1 to N-1, solve the following problem:
Find the number of pairs (i, j) such that the shortest distance between vertex i and vertex j is k.
Input
The only line of the input contains three integers N, A and B.

Constraints:
3 <= N <=2 Ã— 103
1 <= A, B <= N
A+1 < B
Output
For each k = 1, 2,. , N-1, print the answer for the following case in a new line.
